Raspberry Pi Pico Motor Expansion Board
=======================================
The Raspberry Pi Pico Motor Expansion Board is designed to be used as the controller for [OpenTrickler](https://github.com/eamars/OpenTrickler). The board is designed to trickle certain amount of charges (e.g, gun powder) from the reservoir by reading measurements from the attached precision digital balance and actuate corresponding motors.

Peripherals
-----------
* RS232 IO port with either straight through or NULL modem type of connection via on board DB9 connectors. Used to communicate with the precision digital balance. 
* 2x Stepper motor driver socket designed for TMC stepstick drivers. TMC2209 with UART is recommended. 
* 2x EXP ports for [RepRap 12864 LED display](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller)
* A 40 pin socket for Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W. 

Power
-----
The expansion board is designed to be powered by 12V or 24V DC supply. 

PCB
---
The board is designed to be manufactured with 4 layer PCB. Traces are placed at top and bottom layers. Two mid layers are for power (Vcc, 5V) and GND.

Manufacturing
-------------
The board is designed with hand soldering in mind. The board can also be manufactured by SMT. 

BOM and gerber files are provided under [production](production) directory. 

Enclosure
---------
A 3D printable enclosure is also supplied in [enclosure](enclosure) directory. 

Revisions
* v0.1: Initial release.
* v0.2: Add 2x 100uF caps for stepper motor driver power supply. 
* v0.3: Fix issues found on v0.2 design. See details at [release](https://github.com/eamars/RaspberryPi-Pico-Motor-Expansion-Board/releases/tag/v0.3) page. 
Noted the NEOPIXEL output is moved from GP26 to GP13 from this revision.
