# Raspberry Pi Pico Motor Expansion Board V2

The Raspberry Pi Pico Motor Expansion Board V2 vis designed to be used as the controller for [OpenTrickler](https://github.com/eamars/OpenTrickler). The board is designed to trickle certain amount of charges (e.g, gun powder) from the reservoir by reading measurements from the attached precision digital balance and actuate corresponding motors.

## Peripherals

The PINOUT diagram is shown below. To pair with the OpenTrickler controller software, you need to use Pico W as the main controller. 

* EXP1/EXP2: To be paired to [RepRap 12864 LED display](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller) and the compatible display module.

* PWM1/PWM2/PWM3: Can be used to connect with SG90/MG90/S0009M servo motors, or Neopixel RGB LEDs (WS2812)

* UART0: Can be used to connect with external serial to UART adapter, when UART1 is not used. 

* UART1: Compatible with RS232 devices.

## Power

The board is designed to be power from USB-C Charger or power banks. The charger **MUST** support minimum 12V and 2A output. 

**NOTE: The board is NOT compatible with USB-A or USB-B charger or adapter cable. USB-C cable and charger must be used.**

## PCB

The board is designed to be manufactured with 4 layer PCB. Traces are placed at top and bottom layers. Two mid layers are for power (Vcc, 5V) and GND.
