power supply: 
- 35mmx20mm instead of 55mmx22mm (43% reduction)
 - update of components:
    - ch224a vs ch224k (ch224k should be replaced regarding IC supplier)
    - 12pin USB vs 6pin USB (connection of USB lines - additional PD profiles possible)
    - 20V VBUS vs 12V VBUS (less current)
    - LMR51635 vs TPS5450 (smaller size, less additional components)
    - cost reduction of BOM costs
    - 2 layer PCB vs 4 layer PCB
    - EMC safe design
